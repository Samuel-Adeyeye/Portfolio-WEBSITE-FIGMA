This project is one of my early attempts to experiment with HTML and CSS in frontend development. Here, I implemented a figma design to develop a static and simple portfolio website. I plan to improve the functionalities over time.

The 'asset' folder contains downloaded images used in this design.

I also deployed the project on Netlify and you can access the page using this link: https://samuel-portfolio-website.netlify.app/
