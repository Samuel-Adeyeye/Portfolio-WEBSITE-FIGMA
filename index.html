          <p class="page">
            I’m a driven software developer with a growing experience in
            responsive website development. I am constantly looking for new
            opportunities to work with other developers in the industry. I write
            accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and clean JavaScript.
            When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to
            whatever tools are required. I’m based in Benin city, Nigeria, but
            I’m happy to work remotely across teams in different parts of the
            world. When I’m not coding, you'll find me buried in books. I love
            reading, especially books on technology trends and entreprenuership.
            I also enjoy watching football whenever I have some freetime to do
            so. I’d love you to check out my work.
